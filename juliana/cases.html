                            <p> Luna was rescued from a backyard breeder in November 2017. She had several health problems due to the poor conditions she lived. She was one year old when she arrived.
                            Petbyus in partnership with its supporters treated her, spayed, gave her all the vaccines she needed and put her in shape to find her forever home.
                            She found her family in June 2018. Since them, she has been so happy with her two 8 years human brothers Luis and Stefan and her mom Jasmine.
                            Her day basically consists by playing with the boys when they are not studying, cuddling wth her mom and chasing squirrels in the yard.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The first time Jasmine saw he picture on our website she says it was the moment of her life, she knew she would adopt Luna. It was love by first seen. She filled the addoption papers and
                            in less than a month they were living together. Jasmine trained her to be housebroken and help her adaptation with Lucian. Luna learned so fast and now she is a pro with paw tricks.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Luna is a traveler. Since Luna was addopted, she has already visited Vancouver, Nova Scotia and even the Lake Louise with her family.
                            She is living what life has the best to offer. She is a story to remember. <br><br>

                            <p>Alice was rescued in 2016 from the streets. Petbyus treated her, spayed, and gave all the vaccines se needed. She stayed at a foster home for 5 months before being adopted.
                            At first, she was suspicious of everyone. Probably because of what she has seen on the street before being found. She needed leash training and house training by that time.
                            Working with our training partners, they were able to train her and gain her trust. Her foster mom was so in love with her that she decided that she could not think about giving her away.
                            That was when Lucia decided to fill the forms to adopt Alice. They were already bonded and Alice was the partner Lucia needed to give her life a meaning.
                            </p>
                            <p> After 3 years, Alice is a new dog. It appears that she was never a stray dog. She is playfull and wants to talk to everyone she sees on the street. She even like to give kisses for a trat in reward.
                                She knows several tricks and likes to give her belly to call for attention. Whenever she has a foster brother at home, she enjoys the company and offer her toys to play.
                                Its a success after all to see a dog that came so frustrated and suspicous from the streets develop such a good behaviour and bond with her forever family.<br><br>
